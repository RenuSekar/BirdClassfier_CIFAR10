# BirdClassfier_CIFAR10
Bird Classifier project done by building a neural network
Python package : tensorflow, Keras

Inference :
  When training a model on a dataset that contains 60,000 images but only 6,000 of them are bird images (making the dataset imbalanced), the model may struggle to learn to correctly classify birds. This is because the majority of the training data consists of non-bird images, and the model may become biased toward predicting the majority class (non-bird).
